00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.600
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.700
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.700
I just want to tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.700
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.600
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.100
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.900
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.400
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.300
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.400
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.400
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.000
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.100
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.100
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.600
